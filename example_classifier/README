REQUIREMENTS
1. MATLAB (tested with 2014b)
2. PYTHON 2.7 with scipy, numpy, scikit learn
installation instructions
Download anaconda installer from 
https://www.continuum.io/downloads
(this will override the default installation of python)

Any installation of python with the above requirements will work.
See the below instructions for details.

To verify dataset results...
1. Run app.m
Note:
- The script expects a folder containing wav files in the following format e.g Test_1.wav... Practice_2.wav
- Point the script towards this folder by editing the first line in app.m
  testRecordings = getRecordings('Testing_dataset/'); EDIT THE PATH
- We have pre-extracted the ENF signals from the training dataset and included them in our submission. To re-extract
the enf, run extractTrainingENF.m and edit the following line trainRecordings = getRecordings('../training_data/')
to point to the appropriate directory with the training data. This script can take 10-15 minutes to run.
- app.m takes several minutes to run on the provided testing set.
- edit the line [status,cmdout] = system('python app.py','-echo'); to use a different installation of python.
e.g [status, cmdout] = system('C:\Users\Adrian\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\Scripts\python app.py');

For installation problems, bugs etc contact jeremyma.cx@gmail.com

2. View file Results.txt for detailed results and SimpleResults.txt for a string of grid labels in ascending order of test number.
